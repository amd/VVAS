## Prerequisites

- AMD embedded platform with cross-compilation toolchain
- SDK must include: vvas-core, GStreamer 1.18+, XRT, VART, ONNX Runtime

## Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amd/VVAS.git
cd vvas
```

## Build

**Step 1:** Source the cross-compilation toolchain environment:
```bash
source <sdk-path>/environment-setup-cortexa72-cortexa53-amd-linux
```

**Step 2:** Build VVAS:
```bash
./build_install_vvas.sh
```

**Step 3:** Deploy to board:
```bash
scp install/vvas_installer.tar.gz <board-ip>:/
ssh <board-ip> 'cd / && tar -xzf vvas_installer.tar.gz'
```

## Quick Start

After deploying the tarball to the board:

```bash
cd /etc/vvas/examples
./01_quickstart.sh <input.nv12> <width> <height>
```

See [vvas-examples/README.md](vvas-examples/README.md) for all example scripts
and configuration details.

## GStreamer Plugins

| Plugin | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `vvas_xinfer` | ML inference (classification, detection) with ONNXRT and VART backends |
| `vvas_xabrscaler` | HW-accelerated multi-output scaler with mean/scale normalization |
| `vvas_xoverlay` | Draw bounding boxes, labels, and shapes on video |
| `vvas_xmetaconvert` | Convert inference metadata to overlay format |
| `vvas_xmetaaffixer` | Transfer metadata between streams of different resolutions |
| `vvas_xfilter` | Generic filter for custom processing kernels |
| `vvas_xmulticrop` | Crop multiple regions of interest |
| `vvas_xfunnel` | Round-robin stream multiplexer |
| `vvas_xdefunnel` | Stream demultiplexer |

## Supported Inference Backends

| Backend | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| ONNXRT (VitisAI EP) | ONNX Runtime with VitisAI execution provider — HW accelerated |
| VART | Vitis AI Runtime — direct model execution with zero-copy DMA |

## Clean

```bash
./clean_vvas.sh
```
